    `Why do we love football? Because the field is the scene of individual and collective feats that dazzle us, 
    of hopes and expectations, and of pleasant and bitter surprises. We have already seen it in this World Cup. 
    Who expected Spain's early fall or Mexico's draw with Brazil, in which Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa became 
    an impenetrable wall? For some reason, this is the most popular sport in the world, the one that arouses passions 
    like no other.

    “Why do we love football?” is the question that Andrés Roemer and Enrique Ghersi ask themselves in a book of the 
    same title in which they bring together essays by various experts in economics and law. What can such academics 
    tell us about a sport that for many has become almost a spiritual experience or, like fiction, is enjoyed because 
    it offers an escape from real life?

    For Roemer, we like soccer because it creates an order on the field that is respected by everyone. 
    The rules of the game are considered fair when applied by an impartial referee. In that way, it is your own effort 
    and a little luck that determines the results. The concept of 'fair play' is the ideal of any society, and is 
    especially appreciated by those that suffer from poor policies and institutions.

    “One of the greatest strengths of football,” Roemer says, “is its simplicity.” The fact that you only need a 
    ball and an open space explains some of its worldwide popularity. Even more important is the simplicity of its rules: 
    they are clear, predictable and applied evenly. This is equivalent to having legal certainty or a rule of law, if 
    you will, a process that results in a result that is considered fair. When that happens, defeats, as well as 
    victories, are usually accepted by everyone and not considered unfair even when there is (necessarily) 
    inequality between the teams regarding their talent, preparation and skills. Of course the referee may not be 
    good. But he also has to be accountable to the spectators and players in order to continue refereeing future matches.

    Roemer goes further and affirms that football understands human nature. According to him, among the players, 
    coaches and others involved in the sport there are all kinds of characters, some admirable and others not so much, 
    and they are motivated by the pecuniary and the non-pecuniary such as honor, fame or status. The important thing is 
    that clear rules reward excellence, which develops in different ways and flourishes under competition.

    In football, as in the real world, the rules (laws) work when “they are in accordance with what we are and not […] 
    what we should be”, and they are “thought of and applied to people of flesh and blood.” Thus, says the author, 
    “they motivate the most human, the human that we are.”

    The relevance of football for public policies is enormous and can even be applied to the organization of the sport 
    itself. Thus, Ghersi explains that the problem of fan violence is the effect of the lack of private property, since 
    whoever manages a club without owners has no incentive to manage the business in the long term but rather in a 
    "political style." The fact that Peruvian clubs have not become limited companies with a greater interest in 
    investing in players and business may explain why the country has not reached the World Cup for decades. 
    According to Iván Alonso, the important thing is to allow the clubs to organize themselves as for-profit 
    corporations (or however they prefer) and thus see what is best for each club.`,
